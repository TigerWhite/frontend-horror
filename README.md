# Front-end Horror
In daily coding, we come across some code block which are very bad, or blew our mind. I tried to collect some of these codes. Feel free to contribute or share your findings.

I'm not blaming anyone with bad coding. Every developer have some explanation of bad code, tight-schedule, lack-of-experience, irrelevant analysis etc. But at some point every developer should ask themselves, "Can I write this code block any better?"

## HTML Samples
* [Buttons & Links](html/buttons.md)
* [Navigations](html/navigations.md)

## CSS Samples
* [Specificity](css/specificity.md)

## JavaScript Samples
* [Redundancy](js/redundancy.md)


## Contributions
Any contributions you make to this effort are of course greatly appreciated.

However, in the code sample, do not blame anyone or do not link the original code. Also make sure to add a solution of the wrong/bad code. This is not a wall of shame, but I place to learn from mistakes.
