# Front-end Horror

In day-to-day coding activities we come across certain blobs of code nonsense that are so bad that our minds fall off. This repository collects some of those code pieces. 

Feel free to contribute and share your findings.

We are not blaming anyone for bad coding: Every developer has some explanation to their bad code; namely: tight schedules, lack of experience, irrelevant analysis of information, etc. At some point, however, every developer should ask themselves: 

> “Can I write this $#!% any better?!“

## Contributing

Any contributions you make to this effort are greatly appreciated; however, in the code samples, please do not blame anyone and do not link the original code. Also make sure to add a solution to the wrong/bad code. 

This is **not** a wall of shame; it is a collective effort to help us learn from our mistakes.
