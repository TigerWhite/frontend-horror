# Front-end Horror
In daily coding, we come across some code block which are very bad, or blew our mind. I tried to collect some of these codes. Feel free to contribute or share your findings.

I'm not blaming anyone with bad coding. Every developer have some explanation of bad code, tight-schedule, lack-of-experience, irrelevant analysis etc. But at some point every developer should ask themselves, "Can I write this block any better?"
